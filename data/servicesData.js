    faqs: [{
        question: "What exactly does proofreading include?",
        answer: "Proofreading is the final step in the editorial process. It focuses on fixing grammar, punctuation, spelling, typographical errors, and formatting inconsistencies. It does not include major revisions or rewriting—but it ensures your text is clean, professional, and reader-ready."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need proofreading if my book was already edited?",
        answer: "Even the best editing leaves behind occasional errors. Proofreading acts as a safety net to catch small issues that could undermine your book’s credibility. It’s especially important before publishing to platforms like Amazon Kindle Publishing Services or print."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does proofreading take?",
        answer: "Proofreading typically takes 1 to 2 weeks, depending on your manuscript’s length and complexity. We provide a clear timeline at the start of the project and communicate updates as we work."
      },
      {
        question: "Will I see what changes were made?",
        answer: "You’ll receive a version with tracked changes so you can review everything we fixed or adjusted. We also provide a clean version, so you’re ready to move forward with formatting or uploading."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you follow a specific style guide?",
        answer: "No. We don’t use any specific style and follow your custom style guide. Consistency is key, and we ensure your manuscript follows clear and professional standards."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I request a sample before committing?",
        answer: "Yes, we offer a short sample proofread to show you the quality of our work and give you peace of mind before moving forward. It also helps us determine the right approach based on your manuscript’s current condition."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you work with non-native English writers?",
        answer: "We regularly help authors whose first language isn’t English make their writing publication-ready. Our proofreaders ensure clarity, correctness, and natural phrasing without altering your original intent."
      },
      {
        question: "Will proofreading fix plot or structure issues?",
        answer: "No, that’s handled during developmental or line editing. Proofreading focuses on surface-level corrections. If we spot major issues during proofreading, we’ll let you know and recommend the right service."
      },
      {
        question: "What file formats do you accept?",
        answer: "We prefer Word documents (.docx) so we can use tracked changes, but we also accept Google Docs and PDFs. Let us know your preference, and we’ll adapt to your workflow."
      }, {
        question: "Why invest in professional proofreading before self-publishing?",
        answer: "Publishing a book with errors can damage your reputation and lose readers’ trust. Professional proofreading ensures your work reflects your effort and talent. It’s the final polish that gives your book a competitive edge—especially in today’s crowded Amazon Publishing and Kindle Direct Publishing landscape."
